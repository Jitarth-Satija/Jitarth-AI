Jitarth AI ("we", "our", or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle information when you use the Jitarth AI application.

1. Information Collection
Jitarth AI is designed with privacy in mind.

Personal Data: We do not collect personal identification information (like your real name, phone number, or address) unless you voluntarily provide it in the chat.

Chat Data: Your chat history is stored locally on your device or in a secure database managed by the app to provide a personalized experience. We do not sell or share your conversations with third parties.

2. Use of Third-Party Services
Our app uses the Groq Cloud API to generate AI responses. When you send a message, it is processed by the AI model to provide a reply. This data is handled according to the service provider's security standards.

3. Cookies and Local Storage
We use a "Cookie Manager" within the app to keep you logged in and remember your preferences. You can clear these at any time by logging out or clearing your browser/app data.

4. Data Security
We implement standard security measures to protect your data. However, as the app is built for personal and educational purposes, users are advised not to share highly sensitive or financial information with the AI.
